After clustering cells to highly correlated cells, we made custom datasets to feed them to the
comprehensive optimized general LSTM models. Simply, we merged the records of all cells of the same 
cluster which will give the model a better opportunity to be exposed to much more various records around 
this clusterâ€™s cells which will significantly improve the generalization of the model.
